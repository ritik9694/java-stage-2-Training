# Backend Java Developer Training 

## Overview
This repository contains the code developed during my Backend Java Developer training at Cognizant. The project demonstrates enterprise-grade backend development using modern technologies and architectural patterns, with a focus on microservices and cloud-native design.

## Training Highlights
This intensive program covered:

- **Java & Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway, Config Server)**
- **REST & SOAP Web Services**
- **Docker & Kubernetes**
- **JMS (Java Messaging Service)**
- **Unit Testing with JUnit & Mockito**
- **Microservices Design Principles**
- **B2B Integration**

## Project Objectives
- Apply microservices architecture to build scalable backend systems.
- Implement secure and discoverable services using Spring Security and Eureka.
- Containerize services using Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes.
- Integrate messaging systems using JMS.
- Write robust unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
- Explore Gen AI and AWS services for modern enterprise applications.
- Simulate B2B communication patterns.
